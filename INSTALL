Build Instructions
------------------

For most people, the usual:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

is enough. This installs Dovecot under /usr/local.

If you have installed some libraries into locations which require special
include or library paths, you can give them in CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environment variables. For example:

  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/openssl/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/openssl/lib ./configure

See ./configure --help for a list of all available configure options.
See http://wiki2.dovecot.org/CompilingSource for more information.

Running
-------

Start with the example configuration:

  cp -r /usr/local/share/doc/dovecot/example-config/* /usr/local/etc/dovecot/

Read through, and make needed modifications.

Once everything is configured, start Dovecot by running "dovecot" binary.

See Wiki for more information about configuration. If you're in a hurry, go
at least through http://wiki2.dovecot.org/QuickConfiguration

SSL/TLS
-------

Dovecot used to support both GNUTLS and OpenSSL libraries, but nowadays
only the OpenSSL code is working.

  # Here you can give some extra environment variables to mail processes.
  # This is mostly meant for passing parameters to plugins. %variable
  # expansion is done for all values.

  # ACL plugin. vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from maildir
  # directory. You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where
  # ACLs are applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
  # one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox. cache_secs parameter
  # specifies how many seconds to wait between stat()ing dovecot-acl file
  # to see if it changed.
  #acl = vfile:/etc/dovecot-acls:cache_secs=300

  # To let users LIST mailboxes shared by other users, Dovecot needs a
  # shared mailbox dictionary. For example:
  #acl_shared_dict = file:/var/lib/dovecot/shared-mailboxes
}

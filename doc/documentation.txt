Generic information about mail servers
======================================

Dovecot installation
====================

It's a good idea to start with a simple Dovecot installation to see that
everything works. After that you can start changing things one at a time, so if
you run into trouble you know immediately where the problem is.

If you're in a hurry and you already know enough about mail servers,
<QuickConfiguration.txt> may be more helpful to you instead.

#ifndef DATA_STACK_H
#define DATA_STACK_H

/* Data stack makes it very easy to implement functions returning dynamic data
   but without having to worry much about memory management like freeing the
   result or having large enough buffers for result.

   t_ prefix was chosen to describe functions allocating memory from data
   stack. "t" meaning temporary.

   Advantages over control stack:
    - Functions can return a value allocated from data stack
    - We can portably specify how much data we want to allocate at runtime

   Advantages over malloc():
    - FAST, most of the time allocating memory means only updating a couple of
      pointers and integers. Freeing the memory all at once also is a fast
      operation.
    - No need to free() each allocation resulting in prettier code
    - No memory leaks
    - No memory fragmentation

   Disadvantages:
    - Allocating memory inside loops can accidentally allocate a lot of memory
      if the loops are long and you forgot to place t_push() and t_pop() there.
    - t_malloc()ed data could be accidentally stored into permanent location
      and accessed after it's already been free'd. const'ing the return values
      helps for most uses though (see the t_malloc() description).
    - Debugging invalid memory usage requires recompilation with
      -DDISABLE_DATA_STACK which then uses malloc() and free() for all
      allocations and keeping track of them for stack frames making it much
      slower.

   warns if you try to place them in xxx*. See strfuncs.c for examples.

# A sample config file for the language models 
# provided with Gertjan van Noords language guesser
# (http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/)
#
# Notes: 
# - You may consider eliminating a couple of small languages from this
# list because they cause false positives with big languages and are
# bad for performance. (Do you really want to recognize Drents?)
# - Putting the most probable languages at the top of the list
# improves performance, because this will raise the threshold for
# likely candidates more quickly.
